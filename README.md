# guitar-note

## The Idea
I've played guitar for 20 odd years but am rubbish at remembering where the notes are on the fretboard, so why not create an app to help myself learn and remember?

### Implementation
Using html canvas and Vanilla OOP JS we will draw a guitar fret board and assign note values to each fret. Now having this information we can use it for several ideas.
- When a user clicks on a fret then display the current note?
- Create a game that asks you to find a note on a specific string?
- display chord patterns on the fret board?

#Tech stack
